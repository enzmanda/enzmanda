Name is Amanda and I mainly work with powershell in a windows enviroment, as well as some azure, bash and linux related things. Currently I am a junior consultant who really likes to learn and write code. Gonna just add the generic github about me list until I have a more clear idea of what I wish to put here:

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I got started with linux through android and chromebooks, and despite my linux background, the language that I am the most well versed with is powershell. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on pws-tools
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning powershell, azure and azure infrasrtucture
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new smaller open source projects that need small contributions
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with reviewing and feedback of my code!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about powershell, or linux, if you are brave enough
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me personally by looking at my private github account for open source stuff, for business things, I am still figuring that out.

This is my work account, but if you wish to visit my private one for more of a project history, please visit https://github.com/manderio
